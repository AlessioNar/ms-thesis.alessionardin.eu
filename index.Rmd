# Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}

This thesis aims to explore some of the issues concerning the impact of Artificial Intelligence on innovation and specifically whether AI should be considered both as a General Purpose Technology and a research tool that can itself be used to increase the rate of innovation, also defined in the literature as a General Method of Invention. AI can both cause severe disruption in the economy and society and foster economic growth and development. After a historical and conceptual introduction of the mechanics of AI and a presentation of the institutions that regulate innovations (intellectual property rights), the work focus on the impact of AI on innovation, both through a qualitative analysis of the different ways and in which AI can be deployed and through the deployment of traditional and new indicators to detect GPTs in patent data.
