Conclusion {#conclusion .unnumbered}
==========

Artificial Intelligence technologies are one of the critical elements of
change in the short-medium term. The advent of a new GPT (which could
very well be considered GMI[^45]) will deeply change the dynamics of the
economy, politics, society, and international relations. The
multidimensional character of technology influences the power dynamics
between those who will be able to exploit the altered scenario, and
those who will not.

However, it would be fundamentally wrong to adopt a perspective in which
we are merely victims of this transition. While this process of change
cannot be stopped, individual and collective actors can guide and shape
its direction, by establishing norms and institutions that minimize the
damage and maximize the benefits. While science and technology can be
used to pursue political goals, in their essence, their basic principles
are politically agnostic, and only through awareness of the scope of the
impact of these new technologies policymakers can aim to maximize the
social welfare of the AI revolution.

Unfortunately, today, one can observe an increase in the competition
between the major countries in the AI industry: the US and China
[@wipo2019technology], which have launched in a technological race.
While this could be expected, since dominance in AI technologies is
strictly linked to economic and political supremacy, blind competition
is particularly problematic since there is the concrete risk that it
would bring to the overseeing of keystone aspects of AI development,
such as its ethical use. As it was presented in chapter
[1](#chap:ai){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:ai"},
although AI systems represents a fundamental improvement in prediction
technologies, they cannot be considered intelligent in the same way
humans are, and they are marked by flaws and dangers that are very
difficult to forecast or detect. They can safely be used only in
situations where the cost of error is minimal, while for more complex
situations they need to be under human oversight. With the decrease of
prediction cost, the value of judgment increases, especially in complex
situations, where the negative consequences of AI mistakes increase, and
human intervention is needed both for security and monitoring purposes.

In chapter [2](#chap:ip){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:ip"}, some of the main normative constraints that shape
the development of new technologies were presented: Intellectual
Property Rights. The first part evaluated the main economic arguments
put forward to justify their existence and concluded that the only valid
descend from an utilitarian perspective, which does not presume the
introduction of temporary monopoly rights without taking into account
the negative consequences they generate into the economy. Then, the
three IPRs most commonly applied to AI technologies were presented, with
a specific focus on the economics of patents. Finally, economic analysis
was applied to AI technologies, with the objective to verify whether the
claims made by legal scholars on the need to introduce additional IPRs
applicable to AI are justified or not. However, I found that current
evidence does not justify this approach, since no additional incentives
are needed to promote innovation in AI, and since there is a strong
tendency towards self-regulation using patentleft or copyleft models,
this calls towards a reduction in IPRs, rather than the opposite.

Chapter [3](#chap:innovation){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:innovation"} focused on the effects of AI technologies
on innovation and the market. The first part centered on some technology
categorization, namely General Purpose Technologies, Inventions of a
Method of Inventing, and General Methods of Invention. Particular
attention was given to GPTs, since they represent the focus of chapter
[4](#chap:analysis){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:analysis"} and there is a rich literature on their
effects on the economy. A crucial point regards the phenomenon of
innovation complementarities, which describes why GPTs represent a
game-changer in terms of economic growth. Managing the virtuous cycles
of innovation by minimizing the negative impact on employment will
represent a crucial challenge for XXI century policymakers. The second
part of the chapter focused on determining whether AI technologies
possess some characteristics of these technological classes. Using a
qualitative perspective, it is safe to affirm that AI presents features
of both GPTs and IMIs, a combination that the literature could only find
in digital computing. AI is configuring itself as a rapidly evolving,
widely applicable, and complementary technology while at the same time
capable of expanding the knowledge frontier of science and increasing
the rate of scientific discovery. The AI revolution will invest a large
fraction of economic sectors, incentivizing investments in AI research
and development, with effects that will bounce from one sector to
another. Although the invention of multi-function closed-loop Autonomous
Discovery Systems is far from being a reality, AI technologies are
likely to cause an unprecedented increase in productivity in academia,
opening up entire new paradigms of science. Finally, the chapter
concludes by presenting some of the consequences that AI is having on
market structure. In particular, the presence of economies of scope is
leading to a process of market concentrations between a small number of
firms that compete with each other in innovation, conquering new markets
and having higher and higher barriers of entry, represented either by
extreme network effects or the exclusive possession of fundamental
assets such as users' data. Considering that the AI market structure
leaves little space for new entrants, the competition in innovation is
likely to increase, especially now that the COVID-19 pandemic has
prompted world economy in a deep economic crisis, opening opportunities
for a redistribution of global economic power. At the same time, state
and regional actors are trying to manage the digitization of the
economy, with the European Union at the forefront. In particular, two
pieces of legislation are in the process of being evaluated by the
European Parliament: the Digital Market Act (DMA) and the Digital
Services Act (DSA), while a third piece of legislation specifically
targeted to AI technologies is expected in the first quarter of 2021.
The DMA aims to reduce the market power of gatekeepers, multi-products
platforms that have extreme prescriptive and indiscriminate power on
what it can and cannot be done in their platforms, while at the same
time potentially competing with actors using their platforms. The DSA is
instead focused on establishing obligations and accountability for
intermediaries' platforms that provide digital services, and enhance
consumer protection, whether the services are located in or outside the
EU. These sets of norms are characterized by having extraterritorial
character, since their effectiveness is tied to the individual, and not
to the legal site of the firm, and it is conforming to the trend of EU
law launched by the GDPR. Differently from the imposition of additional
IPRs, these sets of norms aim to improve competition and consumer
protection, possibly minimizing the negative consequences of a
widespread introduction of AI technologies.

Finally, chapter [4](#chap:analysis){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:analysis"} objective's was to provide quantitative
evidence to the claims of chapter
[3](#chap:innovation){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:innovation"}: whether AI is a General Purpose
technology, and whether we are assisting to a market concentration
process of the AI market. The data used to perform the analysis was
formed by a subset of PCT patents issued from 1995 to 2017. Most of the
chapter focused on using traditional indicators, such as the generality
index, and developing new indexes based on the evolution of the
technology network formed by AI-related patents. The empirical evidence
shows that AI is indeed a GPT, and that the number of AI-related patents
is increasing at high rates, pointing towards the fact that it is
rapidly pervading our economy in a variety of different application
sectors. However, patent data is intrinsically limited, and the results
of the analysis on market concentration must be treated carefully, as it
can only be deducted that the patent portfolios of strong patentees is
increasing when compared to those of weak patentees, thus suggesting
that some companies are heavily investing in AI technologies.

Being at the dawn of the economic explosion of AI, treating it as a GPT
opens up new prescriptions for policy intervention. From a purely
economic standpoint, we are likely to assist in increases in the
innovation rate in the short term, causing disruptions in the labor
market. Some jobs will cease to exist because human labor will be
substituted by artificial labor [@abrardi2019economics], while new
professional figures capable of building, managing, or operating AI
systems will be needed, creating a mismatch in the labor market. If
policymakers will not draft effective redistribution policies, there is
a substantial risk of deepening existing inequalities between social
groups, leading to unrest and discontent among the *"losers"* of the AI
revolution. @Acosta2019InequalityMP studied the relationship between
income inequality and political polarization, identifying how economic
factors have a deep impact on voting behavior. In particular, they
confirmed the assumption that governments parties get penalized in
periods of poor economic performance, and proved that income inequality
has become a main driver for the success of far-right political parties,
while structural unemployment favors far-left parties. More
interestingly, they also affirmed that political polarization was
reduced in contexts where income inequality was countered by specific
policies, either in the form of progressive taxation or by addressing
the job market mismatch. Technological advancement can be considered one
of the factors at the root of political polarization but, at the same
time, while its direction and pace can be guided and influenced, it
cannot be stopped. The Luddite fallacy is an ever-present threat when
dealing with technological innovation, however economic and political
analysis show us that states where short-sighted emergency policies have
not solved structural problems, and we assist to a rise of political
extremism, while at the same time they lag behind other countries in
terms of economic performance, up to a point where the resources to make
structural reforms lack. At the same time, excessive regulation in the
digital arena may lead to a reduction in the economic competitiveness in
the international scenario. The extent to which a country will be
successful in dealing with the AI revolution thus will be largely depend
on its ability to balance incentives for technological innovation and,
the implementation of labour policies that prepare the workforce to
switch occupation towards the new opportunities offered by AI
technologies, and ensuring competitiveness in the digital market, that
has now reached a prominent place in the economy.

AI technologies are configuring as a key factor of change in the
international and national economy. They are expanding the borders of
what is technically possible and conceivable by human societies, but
with great power comes great responsibility. If not properly guided,
mismanaged innovation can have devastating effects on social cohesion,
potentially paving the way for increasing inequality and authoritarian
regimes. Ethical use of AI technologies is key to ensure a future that
is sustainable, rich, and fair. While regulation of what can or cannot
be produced may be seen as a cost in the short term, if properly
designed it may lead to enhanced social welfare in the medium-long term.
