Intellectual Property Rights 
============================

Intellectual property law is one of the main policy instruments used to
guide the impact and direction of innovation efforts. Formally, its goal
is to encourage innovation and creation of intellectual goods by
facilitating the innovators' appropriation of the derived benefits.
Following the rise in the rate of innovation that marked the 21st
century, further enhanced by the digital revolution, IPRs have been
increasingly contested by different stakeholders. IPRs incentivize or
deter specific innovative behaviors, playing a fundamental normative
function in determining the rate and trajectory of innovation efforts.

First, I will present the foundations of IPRs, starting from the
philosophical and economic justification for creating a property right
in intangibles. Second, I will present some of the IPRs involved in
Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the economics of patents and
presenting the legal framework surrounding copyright and the database
sui-generis right. Finally, I will examine whether the claims regarding
the potential introduction of new IPRs to AI technologies are justified
from an economic perspective.

Foundations of Intellectual Property
------------------------------------

@spence2007intellectual defined intellectual property rights as a
*\"right that can be treated as property to control particular uses of a
specified type of intangible asset\"*, suggesting IPRs protection covers
only specific kinds and uses of intangible assets. In other words, the
property right does not directly involve the intangible asset but rather
the right to exclude others to make specific uses of it.

### Justifications for the existence of intellectual property rights

A complete review of the philosophical and economic justifications of
existence of IPRs would go well beyond the scope of this dissertation,
thus I will focus on the three most common explanations: the natural
rights argument, the desert argument, and the utilitarian argument,
which has traditionally been the most influential in constructing a
legal framework for IP [^1].

#### The natural rights argument

The natural rights argument, first expressed by John Locke in the Second
Treatise of Government [-@locke1600treatise], is based on the assumption
that people are naturally entitled to the fruits of their labor,
including the fruits of their intelligence. He affirmed that: *\"The
labour of his body and the work of his hands, we may say, are strictly
his. So when he takes something from the state that nature has provided
and left it in, he mixes his labour with it, thus joining to it
something that is his own; and in that way he makes it his property\"*
[@locke1600treatise]. However, this approach to IPRs cannot be
considered valid on at least two different basis. First, it justifies
control over the elements of an intangible asset for which a creator is
responsible. However, intangible assets are very problematic because it
is impossible to determine which assets the creator is genuinely
accountable for. @nozick1974anarchy presented a counterargument by
comparing newly produced knowledge to tomato sauce spilled in the ocean.
If somebody owns the tomato sauce (the intellectual labor) and drops it
into the sea (the entire global knowledge), is it right for him to claim
the ocean as a whole as his? @locke1600treatise himself provided the
second objection to the natural right argument. He assumed that this
appropriation system could be applied only when appropriation does not
leave anybody else worse off, which is not always the case. Even when a
creator can claim a specific asset's origin, he is not necessarily
entitled to control its use. Imposing a normative claim would preclude
the user's autonomy and, therefore, make him worse off, invalidating the
appropriation process.

#### The desert argument

Another commonly used justification of IPRs is that an intangible
asset's creator deserves to benefit from his labor. This is generally
referred to as the *desert argument*. On the other hand, this argument
does not consider that property rights are not the only way to reward a
creator. As @hettinger1989justifying points out, laborers may perform
intellectual work only for the end of performing it, such as genuine
interest in that field of knowledge, society's progress, ethical
reasons, and so on so forth. In those cases, other possible rewards are
recognition, gratitude, or public financial support to continue pursuing
their work. IPRs are only one of several possible means to provide
incentives to intellectual laborers, and exclusive property rights may
impose an unnecessary cost to society.

#### The utilitarian argument {#utilitarian}

The utilitarian approach is the one that has historically prevailed, and
most contemporary legal and economic arguments regarding IPRs are based
on this paradigm. Unlike other arguments, the utilitarian approach in
the past was supported by policy objectives and allegations such as
*\"industrial progress is desirable, inventions is a necessary condition
of industrial progress, not enough inventions will be made or used
unless effective incentives are provided\"* [@machlup1950patent]. It is
based on the economic theory of public goods [@samuelson1954pure]:
rather than focus on the creator, its primary concern is the community
as a whole, and it aims to improve the allocation of resources to
maximize the benefits of society through the analysis of economic
welfare.

@greenhalgh2010innovation affirmed that *\"if a firm cannot charge all
the beneficiaries of its innovation, then there is a problem of matching
incentives to the value of the activity, which may lead to an
undersupply of innovation.\"* In economics, this is commonly referred to
as *market failure*. In the case of the allocation of benefits related
to the production of knowledge, market failure may occur when knowledge
is either described as a pure public good or as a private good with
positive externalities.

### The economics of intellectual property

#### Knowledge as a public good

According to @arrow1962economic and @stiglitz1999knowledge, free of any
artificial construct, knowledge is both non-rivalrous and
non-excludable, thus making it a public good. Public goods are those
*\"which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's
consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other
individual's consumption of that good\"* [@samuelson1954pure].

A non-rival good in consumption means that the consumption of the good
$x$ by an individual $A$ does not preclude the consumption of the same
good of another individual $B$, thus making the marginal cost of
consumption equals to zero. Common examples of public goods are
sunlight, radio transmission, public roads, and national defense. Public
goods are often defined in contrast to private goods, which are those
goods $y$ whose consumption from an individual $A$ precludes the usage
of another individual $B$, such as food, energy, or drinkable water. For
example, an apple is a private good because if person $A$ eats it, it
prevents the usage of person $B$. Conversely, sunlight is non-rivalrous
because both $A$ and $B$ can enjoy it without precluding the other from
consuming it. When treated as a public good, knowledge has often been
assimilated with information [@archibugi2015knowledge]. When somebody
consumes information, it does not reduce the quantity available to other
individuals, making it non-rivalrous. While knowledge may be costly to
produce, the marginal cost of sharing information with an additional
individual is zero [@leveque2004economics]. For example, there is a zero
cost of providing the notion of a mathematical theorem to an additional
individual. However, as pointed out by @greenhalgh2010innovation, while
the use of knowledge from one actor does not prevent other actors from
using it, its diffusion may exhaust the profits that can be obtained
from it[^2]. While information in itself is non-rival, the value
associated with it can be rivalrous.

The other fundamental characteristic of public goods is that they are
non-excludable, which means it is challenging (if not impossible) to
exclude a potential consumer from using them. Recalling the previous
examples, while it is relatively straightforward for $A$ to prevent $B$
from eating his apple, it is almost impossible for $A$ to prevent $B$
from enjoying the sunlight.

Several methods were used to prevent access to knowledge in the past:
@archibugi2015knowledge list three of them: secrecy, access codes, and
IPRs. The first method, secrecy, is widely diffused both in the military
and business sectors. It relies on the underlying assumption that the
best way to ensure the appropriability of the economic returns of
knowledge is to prevent its diffusion. However, secrecy provides only
partial protection. Practices such as headhunting, espionage, and
reverse engineering can circumvent business and governmental agencies'
security measures and undermine their efforts. Moreover, since secrecy
guarantees appropriability by impeding information diffusion, it has the
downside of hindering the possibility for third parties to engage in
cumulative innovation and encourage the duplication of R&D expense,
reducing the overall economic welfare. Access codes are instead
technological tools that prevent the unwanted diffusion of knowledge.
While they increase the difficulty of access, they do not provide total
protection. A single breach in the defense systems of businesses and
governmental agencies, coupled with the non-rival nature of knowledge,
may idle their protective measures. Finally, IPRs are a family of legal
instruments that, with specific limitations, allow their owner to
exclude other individuals from enjoying the benefits of the knowledge
they safeguard.

When a good is both rival and excludable, it is generally considered a
private good. In opposition, when it is both non-rival and
non-excludable, it is usually considered a public good. However, there
are also other dimensions, such as when products are non-rivalrous but
excludable or when they are rivalrous but non-excludable. The former are
generally referred to as club (or network) goods while the latter are
referred to as common goods [@archibugi2015knowledge]. A typical example
of a club good is on-line streaming services. While the consumption by
one individual of streaming services such as Netflix or Disney+ does not
prevent other individuals from enjoying them, they are potentially
excludable by imposing a paywall that restricts access to those paying a
monthly subscription. On the other hand, examples of common goods are
ocean fisheries and forestry. While the consumption of fish in the ocean
or wood in forests is rivalrous because excessive fishing or
deforestation can deplete resources, it is challenging to restrict
access.

#### Knowledge as a private good with positive externalities

Opposed to @arrow1962economic and @stiglitz1999knowledge, modern
economics of science and innovation considers in his analysis the highly
differentiated forms of knowledge. This perspective rejects the
comparison between information and knowledge [@pavitt1987nature]
because, depending on the specific traits of the knowledge transferred,
the consumer may experience high transaction costs, undermining the
assumption that all knowledge can be considered a public good.
@callon1994science distinguishes between freely available knowledge and
knowledge that can be used without incurring costs underlined that,
except for few specific cases (such as consuming a drug or using a
computer program with an already known interface), the acquisition of
knowledge requires additional efforts from the consumer (such as
learning time or other resources). Later, @stiglitz1999knowledge
dismissed this aspect, affirming that @arrow1962economic's definition of
public goods does not consider the consumer perspective but only the
producer's. However, if we include in the definition of public goods
also the transaction costs bore by the consumers, knowledge may be
considered either a public or a private good based on the specific kind
of knowledge we examine. As formulated by @archibugi2015knowledge,
*\"what makes knowledge different from public goods is not the related
production process, rather its process of diffusion, which has been
scarcely addressed in standard economic theory.\"*

The heterogeneous dimension of knowledge may influence the positioning
of knowledge as a private or public good [@nelson1959simple]. While
basic research can be assimilated to a public good because it is
possible to apply it in many different areas, knowledge regarding
innovation in a product or a process directly applicable in the market
can be assimilated to a private good with positive externalities
[@greenhalgh2010innovation]. Positive externalities arise when a
producer's behaviors enhance other firms' profits, leading to a
misallocation of benefits.

The traditional economic argument in favor of IPRs is that, without a
mechanism of appropriation for intellectual work, sometimes creators
will not have any incentive to innovate and produce knowledge,
potentially leading to its sub-optimal provision. @coase1960problem
suggested that this could be solved by introducing clear and defined
property rights. Positive externalities could be compensated by
requiring a fee from the beneficiaries, and negative externalities could
be offset by charging a tax to the responsible. In the absence of
appropriate incentives for innovation, then IPRs represents a way to
ensure the appropriability of the benefits raised by the innovation
process.

### The traditional economic model for IPRs introduction {#general_incentive}

Imagine a perfectly competitive market composed of a large number of
firms that produce a standardized product. The price $P_{0}$ is equal to
the marginal cost of production ($P_{0} = MC_{0}$). In perfect
competition, economic welfare is entirely comprised of consumer surplus,
while producer surplus is equal to zero. When a process innovation is
introduced, it reduces the marginal cost of production from $MC_{0}$ to
$MC_{1}$. If we consider knowledge as a non-excludable good, and the
innovation can immediately be applied to the production process by all
firms in the market, the increase in economic welfare involves only
consumer surplus. In contrast, producer surplus remains equal to zero.

This may lead to the conclusion that, in the absence of an
appropriability mechanism, producers have no economic incentive for
innovation. The introduction of temporary monopolistic rights over the
produced knowledge (such as IPRs), when assigned to innovators, aims to
provide this economic incentive.

If we add IPRs to the model, its owner is the only individual that can
benefit from the cost reduction created by innovation, either through
direct application in the production process or by licensing it to other
firms. Therefore, during the protected period, the price will remain
$P_{0}$, while the marginal cost of production for the innovator will
decrease from $MC_{0}$ to $MC_{1}$. The consumer surplus will remain
stable, and the innovating firm will enjoy a profit equal to
$(P_{0}-P_{1})Q_{0}$. However, the market will also experience a
deadweight loss equal to

$$DW = \frac{(P_0 - P_1)(Q_1 - Q_0)}{2}$$

where $Q_1$ is the quantity of the good that would have been produced
without IPRs. While the economic welfare is higher than in the scenario
without the process innovation, it is still lower than without IPRs,
meaning that it is not Pareto efficient. However, after protection
expires, the producer surplus is zeroed, and consumer surplus is
maximized, leading to Pareto efficiency.

IPRs](images/chap2/simplemodel3.png){#fig:simplemodel3 width="7cm"}

Assuming that, in the absence of IPRs, no innovation would have taken
place, while no protection mechanism provides static efficiency, IPRs
encourage the system's dynamic efficiency. The economics of IPRs aims to
balance the dynamic efficiency of continuous innovation and the static
efficiency given by the absence of IPRs.

### IPRs in an oligopolistic market {#oligopolistic}

The trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency is sometimes solved
using competition economics. However, given that dynamic efficiency is
impossible to measure with a satisfactory degree of precision
[@drexl2010research], many economists of the neo-Schumpeterian school
favor caution in applying competition law to IPRs' design, referring to
Schumpeter's argument of *creative destruction*. According to
Schumpeter, capitalism is an evolutionary process that is driven by
*\"new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or
transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial
organization that capitalist enterprise creates\"*
[@schumpeter1942capitalism].

@schumpeter1942capitalism affirms that it would be a mistake to evaluate
oligopolistic structures without considering the evolutionary dimensions
of the capitalist process. In particular, he identified innovation as a
constant source of competition, explaining how even established
oligopolies can be disrupted and countered by new forms of organization
and technological revolutions. Additionally, @schumpeter1942capitalism
examined the relations between IPRs and competition, affirming that
competition policy should consider the positive effects of temporary
monopolies to drive innovation and the creative destruction process
activated by new technologies. He does not deny that, in some cases,
competition policies are necessary to dismantle cartels that are
effectively damaging the system but that drafting precise and effective
policies is very difficult and should be done only on a case-by-case
basis.

Economists advocating for neo-Schumpeterian approaches base their claims
on the argument that monopoly power is necessary to enhance innovation
and dynamic efficiency because monopolies' profit is needed for
investments in future innovation [@drexl2010research]. So, even when IP
confers monopoly power, the latter should be protected against state
intervention because doing otherwise would reduce the innovation
system's effectiveness. Competition policy should not collide with the
allocation of IP rights because the long term effects of these
interventions are challenging to quantify, and on a theoretical basis,
it is never recommended to interfere with the distribution of the
benefits of IPRs. *\"When considering whether forcing the disclosure of
companies' trade secrets or compelling them to license valuable IP,
policymakers must therefore balance the gains from stimulating
short-term competition with the losses from the reduced investment in
innovation. They should keep in mind, however, that while the allocative
efficiencies that arise in the short term as a result of intervention
are relatively easy to measure, the long-term costs of such actions are
uncertain and difficult to quantify.\"* [@geradin2006dg] A
counterargument to the neo-Schumpeterian approach was already pointed
out by @arrow1962economic, which framed the applicability of
@schumpeter1934theory's line of reasoning in terms of incentives to
innovate. In an oligopolistic market, a firm is already making a profit,
and innovation only offers a higher revenue. However, when compared to a
second firm contemplating market entry, the incumbent's marginal
gain[^3] is lower than the one of the potential entrant. This argument
leads to the conclusion that an oligopolistic system, in the absence of
new entrants, is less conductive to innovation. However, as pointed out
by @leveque2004economics, *\"this reasoning ignores competition between
companies to conquer markets. The incentives are different if the
monopoly knows that a competitor can enter its market by inventing and
patenting a less expensive process or a similar new product.\"* When
firms compete for conquering a market, a race towards innovation is very
likely to happen. Competition in the market is then replaced by
competition for the market [@geradin2006dg]. If the incumbent fails, it
will lose the profit provided by the monopoly and the R&D investments,
while if the entrant misses the window, it will only suffer the loss of
the development costs. In this case, the monopolist has a higher
incentive to innovate, even if it will never introduce into the market
the innovative product.

Summing up, competition law is a useful instrument to leave access to a
market open by forcing oligopolies and new entrants to compete with each
other and, coupled with compulsory licenses, promotes the diffusion of
knowledge in the market. Simultaneously, even if IPRs create static
inefficiencies due to their monopolistic nature, in many cases they
maintain the incentives for the production of innovation high, promoting
dynamic efficiency, and discouraging the sub-optimal provision of
innovation. However, such cases are not as frequent as one may think and
that must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As it was
already mentioned, other incentives, economic or not, may already be in
place. IPRs can alter these fragile dynamics, potentially hindering
innovation, as it is claimed by @Brggemann2015IntellectualPR in the case
of sequential innovation.

Three IPRs involving AI technologies: patents, copyright, and database
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An in-depth analysis of the legal and economic features of all of them
would go beyond the scope of this dissertation, thus I will focus on the
main IPRs concerning AI technologies: patents, copyright, and the
database sui-generis right.

### Patents

#### Legal overview

Patents are a legal instrument that allows the patent owner to establish
a temporary monopoly over particular uses of a patented invention.
According to @guellec2007economics, a patent confers on its owner the
exclusive right to prevent third parties to make, use, offer for sale,
sell or import a patented product or the product resulting from a
patented process. Patents only offer protection on a national level,
requiring the patentees to individually seek protection in each of the
countries where one desires to protect the intangible asset. To minimize
legal fragmentation and reduce transaction costs, patent legislation has
progressively harmonized at a global scale by several international
treaties [@charnovitz1998patent].

In 1883 the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property
was signed. It introduced two main provisions: national treatment and
the right of priority. National treatment is a standard principle in
international law that consists of providing to foreigners the same
rights that it grants to its citizens, in our case, the ones concerning
industrial property protection. The right of priority consists of
conceding to the first applicant of a patent the exclusive right to
extend it to other countries for twelve months. Before the Paris
Convention, to ensure protection over his invention, the applicant had
to file a patent in all states at the same time, creating several
logistical issues [@world2004wipo].

The second significant development in the international harmonization of
patent systems was the implementation of the Patent Cooperation Treaty
(PCT), signed in 1970 and entered into force in 1978, which created an
international procedure for patent application. While the examination
and grant of a patent remained a responsibility of the national offices,
the PCT allowed inventors to file a single application stating a list of
countries where he/she desired to obtain protection, and it provided
additional 18 months of priority.

In 1994, the signature of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property
Agreements (TRIPs) introduced the most favored nation principle, a
standard duration of patents, a standard definition of patentable
subject matter, compulsory licensing, and extended patent protection to
test data in agricultural and pharmaceutical products
[@park2008international]. The TRIPs agreement represent the last
development in international patent legislation and determine the
minimum requirements for patenting. Article 27(1) of Annex 1C recites
that: *\"patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products
or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new,
involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application.\"*
Additionally, all jurisdictions exclude from patenting artistic
creations, scientific discoveries, mental acts, abstract ideas, animal
and vegetal varieties, methods for medical treatment, and medical
diagnosis. To this day, the patentability of business methods, software,
and biotechnological products depends on the specific provision of
national legislation. While in the US it is possible to patent business
methods and software, in most European countries it is not
[@wells2001internet].

##### Industrial application

The *industrial applicability* criterion has been introduced to
guarantee the practical utility of granting monopoly rights to the
inventor. In this case, *industry* should be interpreted broadly, with
the meaning that the invention must be applicable for practical purposes
[@world2004wipo]. The economic rationale is to prevent the patenting of
basic upstream applications that could slow down the development of
commercially viable downstream applications, potentially reducing the
net social benefit of society [@guellec2007economics].

##### Novelty

Novelty is an unquestionable requirement for patenting: an invention is
new when the prior art has not anticipated it. *Prior art* is defined as
*\"all the knowledge that existed prior to the relevant filing or
priority date of a patent application, whether it existed by way of
written or oral disclosure\"* [@world2004wipo]. The economic rationale
at the basis of novelty is at the core of the utilitarian justification
for IPRs. Since the introduction of an excludability mechanism involves
a decrease in the static efficiency of the system to promote dynamic
efficiency an innovation, there would be no reason to grant temporary
monopoly rights for an invention that has already taken place
[@guellec2007economics].

##### Inventive step

A third criterion shall be respected: inventive step[^4]. According to
Art. 56 of the European Patent Convention, *\"an invention shall be
considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the state
of the art, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\"* Given
that an invention has industrial applicability and it is novel, why then
require an inventive step? Again, the norm is based on economic
considerations [@guellec2007economics]:

-   **promote competition:** small and incremental innovation is part of
    the routine of many industries. Allowing a firm to patent a marginal
    improvement on a product or a process would prevent the competing
    businesses to innovate and would increase the probability of the
    development of permanent monopolies, hurting market competition;

-   **reduce uncertainty:** requiring a low inventive step increases the
    risk of granting patents that are not novel, increasing the
    probability of raising society's costs without any benefit in the
    long-term. A high inventive step overcomes this issue and
    incentivizes radical innovation over marginal improvement;

-   **ensure sufficient protection to inventors:** an inventive step
    which is too low reduces inventors' incentives because marginal
    improvements could immediately overtake any invention, dissolving
    the economic reward.

These three economic rationales have been included in models by
@o1998patentability and @hunt2004patentability, who analyzed the impact
of the size of the inventive step on innovation. According to their
findings, a low inventive step reduces the lifetime of patents since
patented marginal improvements would overtake them without risking of
infringing them and incentivize investments in small, low-cost, marginal
inventions while discouraging large and high-cost ones. On the other
hand, a high inventive step increases the length of monopoly and the
economic profits for a patented invention, while discouraging marginal
improvements. @guellec2007economics argue that determining the optimal
length of the inventive step is not trivial and largely depends on the
technological field of the innovation. They affirm that small inventions
are valuable for customers and that since, in many cases, significant
innovations are the product of marginal improvements, preventing
patentability would incentivize secrecy and reduce economic welfare.

#### Economic rationale and optimal patent design

Adopting an economic approach to patents allows us to evaluate IPRs from
an efficiency-based perspective, where their introduction is justified
only if they encourage innovation and the diffusion of technology while
minimizing the deadweight loss associated with the temporary
introduction of monopoly rights [@langinier2002economics]. The net
social benefit of an innovation is positive when the welfare it brings
to society exceeds the cost required for its production. On the other
hand, the net individual benefit of an innovation is positive when the
innovator's returns are higher than the R&D cost he incurred during
production. The underlying economic logic behind the patent system is to
find a way to ensure that, when the net social benefit is $\geq0$ and
the net individual benefit is $\leq 0$, the innovation is produced
anyway. Only when the trade-off between the net social benefit and the
individual benefit is positive, a patent should be granted
[@leveque2004economics]. Providing a temporary monopoly right over the
benefits of the invention was the historically chosen solution to this
issue.

Many patent advocates affirm that, by ensuring high profits for the
inventor, the disclosure of knowledge that would otherwise have remained
secret and the creation of a market of tradeable assets would be
encouraged, thus leading to the optimal allocation of productive
resources [@guellec2007economics]. Unfortunately, this is rarely the
case. The introduction of a patent involves two possible scenarios: the
invention would have taken place even without the incentive provided by
a temporary monopolistic right, or it would not. In the first case, from
an economic perspective, the patent system should be structured in such
a way that it is not possible to patent the innovation. However,
determining that would require to evaluate factors such as the R&D costs
of the invention, the risk of the research, the existence of alternative
appropriability mechanisms for its returns, and the possibility of
obtaining it through publicly-sponsored research. Generalizing, only if
the invention is costly, risky, there is no other way of protecting it,
and it is outside the interest of government-funded research, a patent
should be introduced. Unfortunately, this identification process is
costly, complex and largely depends on information that may be known
only to the patent applicant, that has no interest in sharing it with
patenting authorities, since it may result with having its patent
application rejected.

Patents are an exclusionary tool that can potentially hinder innovation,
thus betraying their original purpose: when a general-purpose invention
is patented, it provides the holder with a strong market power that
could prevent diffusion, follow-up research, and increasing the
deadweight loss [@o1998patentability]. This was the case of the patent
granted to George Selden in 1895 for the invention of the automobile
[@howells2016overly]. Selden's application included the combination of
an internal combustion engine in a 4-wheeled car. Selden's claim was
very general and did not specify critical details regarding the engine.
In 1899 he teamed-up with William Whitney and started collecting
royalties from other automobile manufacturers up until Henry Ford and
other four car makers challenged the patent in 1904. In 1911, Selden's
patent was declared invalid by the appeal court. @merges2009trouble
suggests that Selden's rent-seeking behavior may have prevented access
to the automobile market to small firms, discouraging follow-up
research, and potentially impeding innovation. Another famous patent
that arguably impeded innovation was the one granted to the Wright
brothers, who made a modest improvement to flight technology and secured
a patent in 1906. Later they engaged in a fierce legal battle to
monopolize the US airplane industry, imposing prohibitive fees for
economic gain [@boldrin2013case] and effectively hindering follow-up
innovation. When the US entered World War I, the US military did not
have a competitive airplane industry, and the lawsuit was only solved
through political channels by effectively absorbing the Wright patent in
a patent pool composed by the other airplane producers
[@shulman2003unlocking]. On the other hand, the establishment of clear
property rights facilitates the commercialization of the invention,
ensuring the appropriability of returns [@coase1960problem]. Many
research institutes do not have the infrastructures needed to reach
downstream users, and IPRs ease the transfer of these assets to industry
actors through a license [@guellec2007economics].

Moreover, in the absence of a patent system, disclosure rely on the
willingness of the original inventor and the nature of the invention.
While for product innovations there may be other systems of
appropriability of the economic returns such as first-mover advantages
or scale economies, in process innovations the most common alternative
to patenting is secrecy. Therefore, in some cases, patents may favor the
disclosure of process innovations and reduce the risk of the
multiplication of R&D efforts [@archibugi2015knowledge].

*\"Applying this series of tests to individual patent applications or to
entire categories (e.g. technical fields) would make the patent system
of high quality from an economic point of view\"*
[@guellec2007economics]. Unfortunately, applying these criteria to
patent applications is not straightforward. Sometimes disclosure and
exclusivity are in contrast with each other since greater exposure would
facilitate competing firms to *\"invent around\"* the patent, thus
reducing the returns of the innovative firm. In other cases, the
information required to evaluate the impact of an innovation is known
only after years of market introduction or it is not measurable at all.
Additionally, the design of an optimal patent system requires greater
coordination with the authorities in charge of innovation policies and
competition, well beyond the reach of patent offices. Evaluating the
grant of a patent on a case-by-case basis would increase the application
cost, and it would reduce legal certainty, raising the risks associated
with unwanted infringement or of having the patent revoked
[@guellec2007economics]. Since firms' investments in R&D are made
depending on the probability of covering costs and appropriating the
returns for profit, increased uncertainty in the evaluation process has
negative effects on both competition and investment, amplifying business
risk and raising the costs of innovation. Some institutions even
explicitly exclude the use of economic considerations for patent
evaluation, such as the European Patent Office. *\"The EPO has not been
vested with the task of taking into account the economic effects of the
grant of patents in specific areas of technology and of restricting the
field of patentable subject matter accordingly\"*
[@economiceffectpatentability].

Patent breadth (or scope) measures the use that the innovator can make
of the patent compared to his competitors [@leveque2004economics]. It is
not determined by law but results from the combination of the number and
genericity of novelty claims and the inventive step. Patent offices
identify what an inventor has found or not based on the claims present
in the patent application but the definitive scope is determined in
court during a case of alleged infringement[^5].

According to economic theory, the scope of a patent can be divided into
*lagging breadth* and *leading breadth*. Lagging breadth affects
horizontal competition, determining how far competitors should position
their products in order not to infringe. @klemperer1990broad frames it
as the maximal degree of substitutability between the patented invention
and a competing one while @tandon1982optimal defines it as the cost of
inventing a substitutable product. In both scenarios, the competing
products do not infringe on the patent, and the lagging breadth
determines how much competition its owner will face. Taking
@klemperer1990broad's perspective, a broader scope decreases the
substitutability degree of competing products, giving the patent owner
higher market power, while taking @tandon1982optimal's one, it results
in a higher entry barrier to the market and, therefore, weaker
competition. Conversely, leading breadth affects vertical competition,
which is the length of the inventive step needed in downstream research
in order not to infringe the patent. It generally arises in the context
of cumulative innovation [@guellec2007economics], where an invention is
needed for another one to happen [^6]. In a two-stages development
scenario, where two different research entities contribute to innovation
and the revenue is generated in the downstream sector, leading breadth
determines how the profit be shared between them. *\"Granting too narrow
a patent at one stage will reduce the negotiating power of the inventors
at that stage as opposed to the inventors of the other stage, lowering
their reward and, therefore, their incentive to invent in the first
place, possibly blocking the innovative chain. Conversely, too broad a
patent might lead inventors to require too high a share of the total
reward, at the expense of other inventors, who might then choose to keep
out, also breaking the chain\"* [@guellec2007economics].

Summing up, an increased lagging breadth reduces the possibility of
competitors entering the market and offering similar products, while a
higher leading breadth makes it more difficult for competing innovators
to patent marginal innovations based on the first patent
[@scotchmer2004innovation]. Balancing out leading and lagging breadth is
not trivial and economists suggest three main approaches.

The first approach advocates for the creation of deep patents that cover
all innovations that follow an initial discovery. @kitch1977nature
proposes that deep patents allow the inventor to organize research
efficiently, discouraging patent races and excessive investments. Other
firms can then identify new applications and propose them to the patent
owner and request a license or offering research partnerships as they
would represent a new flow of revenue. However, these arguments are
highly controversial. High uncertainty and asymmetrical knowledge may
increase the complexity of the negotiations (and therefore transaction
costs), since no party may be willing to share valuable information
regarding the specifics of their invention for fear of imitation. Broad
upstream patents may affect the early disclosure of fundamental
innovations, incentivizing secrecy and preventing other researchers from
investigating other applications of the invention [@matutes1996optimal].
These rent-seeking behaviors may lead to patent races: firms may compete
to be the first one to breakthrough and appropriate the totality of the
revenues of the invention. Additionally, in many fields of research, the
issue is not over-investment, rather under-investment. Even if the
problem were over-investment, promoting broad upstream patents would not
solve it but rather move it from the downstream to the upstream stage,
reducing the profitability of downstream research and therefore risking
an under-provision in that sector.

A second approach has been taken in the field of software. While
computer programs *as such* are excluded from patenting[^7], it is still
possible to patent software applications which use a mathematical
formula in a specific way for a particular purpose. This resulted in the
incentivization of extremely narrow patents, which constitute prior art
[@neuhausler2019computer], incentivizing sequential innovation.

The third approach involves not applying intellectual property at all
when innovations are cumulative, imposing the same non-patentability
conditions as a requirement for licensing. Innovators directly compete
with each other in the market, having a lower incentive to invest in R&D
but having the possibility to draw from all existing innovations,
reducing the costs derived from licenses, and eliminating the risks
associated with possible infringement [@bessen2009sequential]. This is
another common approach used in the software industry, promoted by the
open-source movement. In copyright legislation it is referred to as
copyleft, while in patent legislation is referred to as patentleft
[@dusollier2007sharing].

##### Patent duration {#duration}

TRIPs agreements fixed the maximum duration of a patent at 20 years from
filing, making it almost uniform all over the world. Limiting the
temporal length of protection is the easiest way for legislators to
control the monopoly rights given to innovators. A longer duration would
grant additional profits to innovators, and therefore it would increase
their economic incentives. On the other hand, from an economic
perspective, protection should be eliminated as soon as the innovator as
received a reward equals to the profit it would have obtained if he
invested the same amount of resources elsewhere, such as in bank
deposit. In this framework, the discount rate is the first limit on the
efficiency of long patents: the more distant in time the expected profit
from the innovation, the less able it is to compete with the cumulative
interest that a bank account would generate [@scotchmer2004innovation].
Another reason for limiting the duration of patent protection are
transaction costs [@langinier2002economics]. Among time, subsequent
inventions dilute the contributions to the technology provided by each
inventor, and establishing the participation of an inventor to the new
knowledge becomes more and more expensive as technology evolves
[@leveque2004economics].

Having determined that limited duration is essential for patents, how
long should protection last? In other words, how is it possible to
balance out the dynamic efficiency of a patent? @nordhaus1969economic
developed a model to determine optimal duration that minimizes the
discounted value of the deadweight loss generated by the patent over its
entire life under the constraint that the discounted profit of the
innovator exceeds his R&D expenses. He affirms that duration and the
scope of patents should depend on the particular characteristics of the
reference market since different products and processes may have
different optimal extents of protection. Thus the optimal solution would
be to grant different protection lengths to innovations in different
sectors, based on the cost of the invention and the shape of the
deadweight loss as a function of price and time. Unfortunately, the
current patent system establishes a standard maximum length to all
patents, even if the R&D expenses greatly vary between different
sectors. While there is a renewal system based on fees [@de2013role], in
which, periodically, firms can choose to extend the duration of
protection, the deadweight loss imposed by a patent may still be higher
than the benefit to society. The profits derived from a patent may be
higher than the renewal fees even after the complete recovery of the R&D
costs, thus blocking the diffusion of socially valuable inventions and
encourage rent-seeking behavior, undermining the efficiency of the
system.

To determine the optimal patent design, different combinations of length
and scope can be used. The same economic reward could be obtained by
either increasing the scope or the length of protection. Different
approaches have been taken to strike a balance, notably by
@tandon1982optimal, @gilbert1990optimal, and @gallini1992patent.
According to @tandon1982optimal and @gilbert1990optimal, the optimal
combination of duration and scope largely depends on the elasticity of
demand, which influences the impact of price on the deadweight loss.
Patent protection is framed as the power it confers on the market.
Following this understanding, a broad patent reinforces the monopoly of
the innovator by excluding from the market products that are substitutes
for it but that are substantially different. So, if the product
elasticity is high, deadweight loss increases faster with breadth than
with length, leading to the conclusion that narrow and long patents are
preferable. Conversely, when the product is highly inelastic, deadweight
loss increases faster with duration than with breadth, making short and
broad patents more desirable. A different approach was taken by
@gallini1992patent, which instead took into consideration the effect of
patent breadth on competition. She defined breadth as the R&D costs of
imitation of an innovation without infringing its patent. Patents are
framed as the conditions under which the innovator shares the market.
*\"The longer the patent, the more incentive imitators have to invest in
the creation of alternative technologies. By contrast, a broad patent
makes it costly for imitators to enter the market. In other words, a
long patent attracts imitators by giving them the time to recover the
cost of their imitation, whereas a broad patent dissuades imitators by
increasing the cost of imitation.\"* [@gallini1992patent] However, the
R&D expenditure undertaken by imitators is wasted because the patent
technology has already been developed. Because of these considerations,
she concluded that short and broad patents are preferable because it is
better to have a strong monopoly for a short period than an oligopoly
for a longer period coupled with worthless imitation costs.

### Copyright

Copyright is a legal instrument used to protect *\"any literary,
dramatic, musical or artistic original work, provided that is recorded,
either in writing or otherwise\"* against imitation
[@spence2007intellectual]. Contrary to patents, it only protects against
the exact reproduction of the work and not independent creation.
Copyright gives authors an exclusive right over the reproduction,
performance, adaptation, and translation of their work. The criteria
used to determine whether an intangible asset can be subject to
copyright protection are very inclusive. Work is defined as any quantity
of material assembled with some conscious ordering. There is no judgment
of quality or contents in the definition of literary: originality does
not require any inventive step, only an intellectual effort of some kind
[@spence2007intellectual]. Additionally, copyright legislation also
covers a range of related rights, which are rights of creative works not
connected with the works' authors. They include the rights of
performers, phonogram producers, broadcasting organizations, and, within
the European Union, the rights of film producers, database creators,
semiconductors, and industrial design. Provided these general
requirements, it is clear how the subject matter of copyright protection
is extensive. It encompasses many industries, such as visual arts,
publishing, performing arts, and, since the digital revolution, digital
products such as software code and databases.

Civil law and common law regimes adopts two different approaches. In
common-law copyright is understood solely as a set of economic rights
that aim to guarantee the economic appropriability of the production of
knowledge. They include the exclusive right for the reproduction,
distribution, renting, lending, public performance, and making
adaptations of the work, such as translating or dramatizing a literary
work and transcribing or producing an altered version of a musical work
[@spence2007intellectual]. On the contrary, in civil law regimes, other
rights (commonly referred to as moral rights) such as paternity, false
attribution, and integrity, are associated with the economic rights. The
distinction between common law and civil law approaches to copyright is
reflected even in terminology. While in the US and former Commonwealth
countries, the legal term to define these IPRs is copyright, in civil
law countries, more emphasis is put on the author figure, and therefore
they are referred to as author's rights (generally using the French term
*droits d'auteur*).

Differently from patents, that have a registration system that requires
the filing of an application to obtain protection, copyright does not
have a registration system. Protection is granted since the act of
creation of the work, and it is automatically awarded to the author
[@spence2007intellectual]. However, sometimes the identification of the
author is not so trivial as one may expect. According to
@versteeg1995defining, an author is an individual who has actively
created something copyrightable, as the writer, the photographer, or the
composer.

From a historical perspective, the author is a legal figure born in XVII
century England, in the context of the dispute Donaldson v. Becket.
Donaldson was a Scottish bookseller whose business model consisted of
reprinting classics of English literature. When he published James
Thomson's book *\"The Seasons,\"* Becket and a group of London
booksellers sued him for infringement, since they allegedly claimed they
detained the copyright [@rose1988author]. At the time, copyright in the
United Kingdom was protected by the Statute of Anne (1709), which
granted limited protection of fourteen years to books with a possible
second term if the author was still living. The Statute was based on the
Stationers' Company regulations, a publishers' association that
regulated the printing of books in London. It introduced a temporal
limit of protection and the possibility for authors to become copyright
holders, effectively giving birth to the author as a legal figure. In
England, copyright was a right created for publishers, responsible for
the diffusion of literary works. While at the dawn of copyright
legislation it was relatively easy to determine the author of a work,
with the progressive expansion of copyright subject matter and
complexity, it has become increasingly challenging to assign
attribution. In the past, business models such as work-for-hire and
technological innovations such as film-making questioned the traditional
association of property rights with authorship, leading to the creation
of models of attribution tailored to the specific issues. Today,
AI-created works are putting these models again to the test.

#### Length

Copyright protection starts from the moment the work is created, and it
proceeds until some time period after the author's death. The ratio of
this provision is to allow the author's successors to benefit
economically from the author's work. In some legislation, moral rights
continue in perpetuity. In the Berne Convention, the minimum duration of
copyright protection is fixed at 50 years after the death of the author.
However, more and more countries are extending the length of protection
to 70 years, to harmonize with US and EU IP regimes. In some cases,
specific categories of works (such as anonymous, cinematographic, and
posthumous works) are awarded a different length of protection to
minimize the deadweight loss to society. When copyright protection
expires, works enter into the public domain and are freely accessible by
everyone.

International copyright legislation is highly fragmented, and it is
currently formed by an interlocking system of treaties formed by the
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works of
1886, the Universal Copyright Conventions of 1952 and 1971 and the WIPO
Copyright treaty of 1996. Additionally, neighboring rights are regulated
by ad-hoc treaties such as the Rome, Geneva, and Brussels Conventions
and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. In 1994, the adoption
of the TRIPs agreement contributed to the harmonization of international
copyright law, but the global legal framework is still disjointed. Some
countries have adopted all the latest multilateral treaties, while
others abode only the minimum standard required by previous agreements
[@goldstein2001international].

Compared to patents, which in almost all legislation have a standard
limit of protection of 20 years from filing, copyright has an unusually
long term of protection. The economic rationale is that the success of a
work is highly uncertain, and it can come many years after the first
edition. So, a long span of protection represents an additional
guarantee for the author to obtain the profit from his work, even if it
is delayed in time [@landes2003indefinitely; @diderot1767lettre]. In
this way, the creator's lower profit in each period is compensated by a
higher number of periods, to enable him to recover his cost and provide
him with sufficient incentive [@landes2003indefinitely]. On the other
hand, the unusual length of copyright protection may have also arisen
from the intense lobbying of interest groups in the show business
industry. Initially set at 14 years, copyright in the US has been
gradually extended to the current 70 years after the author's death.
While this unusual length may be partly justified in the context of
literary works, with the expansion of the scope of copyright to works
that are technology themselves, or essential inputs for the production
process, such as software or databases, 70 years after the author's
death greatly increase the deadweight loss, suggesting that a revision
may be needed for specific products.

#### Scope

Copyright protects the exact reproduction of the author's works and not
the act of using the ideas expressed, considered the building blocks of
knowledge and fundamental for transmission. Word strings and music are
protected, as other ordered strings of symbols such as software, but not
algorithms. In the US legislation, the dichotomy between ideas and
expression is solved by the doctrine of *\"comprehensive nonliteral
similarity,\"* [@mohler1999toward] where the line between infringement
and autonomous creation lies on the evaluation of mechanical changes are
made, such as changing the names of the characters in a short story or
renaming the variables in software.

Copyright protection is also subjected to several limitations. First of
all, some categories of work might not be protected at all.
International legislation requires that a work is fixed in a tangible
form, and therefore non-registered works fall out of copyright
protection. Additionally, some legislation explicitly exclude from
protection works such as laws, court sentences, and administrative
decisions [@goldstein2001international]. Second, some forms of
exploitation of a work that theoretically would require a license may be
carried out without explicit permission. Article 9, par 2 of the Berne
Convention affirms that reproduction rights may be granted, *\"in
certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict
with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the author\"*. Third, it is
possible to grant compulsory licenses regarding certain individual
cases, such as the mechanical reproduction of musical work and
broadcasting. Similarly to patents, the author receives an economic
compensation, but the amount is generally decided by a court or by the
consumer [@world2004wipo].

The reason for these exceptions lies in economics. When a consumer gives
a low but positive value to a work, and they are not willing to meet the
cost of a transaction with the copyright holder, the diffusion of the
work may be reduced to a sub-optimal level, diminishing the overall
economic welfare [@landes1989economic]. To solve this problem, the US
developed the *fair use* doctrine which, by analyzing the nature and the
purpose of the usage of the work, determines whether a copyrighted work
can be used without the permission of its author [@depoorter2002fair].
The doctrine has no equivalent in Europe, but it is considered
admissible in some national law regimes. Fair use exceptions generally
include citations, news reporting, and use of the works for teaching
purposes. Additionally, depending on the legislation, copyright
protection may be limited by a range of defenses such as fair use for
non-commercial purposes (private study and research), public interest,
parody, review, and criticism.

### Databases

The recent technological advancements and the development of a
data-driven economy prompted many business and industries to push their
government for the introduction of a new right for protecting the
investments made in databases. Database production is a long and
expensive process, but ordered and easily searchable data-sets are
essential prerequisites for many information services, and the basis for
ML-powered AI.

Potentially, databases could be covered by copyright, under the
definition of literary work and in compliance with the Berne Convention.
Additionally, article 5 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996), states that
*\"compilations of data or other material \[...\] which by reason of the
selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual
creations, are protected as such. \[...\] This protection does not
extend to the data or the material itself and without prejudice to any
copyright subsisting in the data or material contained in the
compilation\"*. However, copyright protection requires a creative effort
and originality, and it is conceptually difficult to stretch these
elements to databases. This opinion was first expressed with the
sentence of the US Supreme Court in the case Feist v. Rural Telephone
Service Company in 1991. Rural was a public utility providing telephone
services to various communities in Kansas and published databases of
telephone address. Feist extracted information from the database in
question, and Rural accused them of being in infringement. The US
supreme court sentenced that the database was not eligible for copyright
protection because it lacked the requirement of originality, and its
creation did not involve any creative effort, rather the opposite: the
intellectual capital of databases depends on completeness, ease of
access, and the standardized categorization of information. Databases
are hardly created from scratch. On the contrary, they draw information
from preexisting databases and other sources of data. On the other hand,
applying copyright legislation to databases has raised more than one
eyebrow: given the particular nature of the subject matter, applying the
entire length of copyright protection to databases could potentially
lead to a disproportionately higher welfare loss.

Still, a part of the database industry lamented the absence of a system
of protection for uncopyrightable databases as a potential cause of
market failure, where free-rider competitors who contributed nothing to
the data collection could appropriate the returns of the producer's
investments. Therefore, starting from the 1960s, some European states
created a series of legislative instruments to protect databases that
fell outside the scope of copyright protection. Since legal
discrepancies between the EU Member States could potentially harm the
free-flowing of goods within the Digital Single Market (DSM), in in 1992
the European Commission drafted a proposal for a Directive on the Legal
Protection of Databases that introduced a sui-generis right for
databases, and was later amended and entered into force in 1996. The
Directive was not self-executable, and it needed the implementation law
by the Parliaments of the Member States. While within the EU, the
harmonization was concluded in 1998, at the international level the
reciprocal character of the Directive has created pressures for the
acceptance of the EU model of database protection.

#### The European Directive on databases

Article 1(2) defines a database as *\"a collection of works, data or
other independent materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way
and capable of being accessed by electronic or other means.\"* The
directive excludes *\"computer programs used in the manufacture or
operation of databases which can be accessed by electronic means.\"*

In Art.3(1), the Directive distinguishes two different scenarios for a
database. When the database already enjoys copyright protection, since
the creative effort required for its creation makes it eligible for
copyright protection and when it does not. When the database enjoys
copyright protection, the Directive provides the author the standard
copyright legislation, depending on how Member states structured the
national law of application. Still, this provision cannot unreasonably
prejudice the rightholder's legitimate interests or conflicts with the
normal exploitation of the database. When a database does not enjoy
copyright protection, it falls within the scope of the sui-generis
right, that is the novel element of the European Directive, conditioned
to the ability of the *compiler* of demonstrating that there has been a
*\"qualitatively and/or quantitatively substantial investment in either
the obtaining, verification or presentation of the content to prevent
extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part,
evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that
database.\"*

Extraction and re-utilization are precisely defined in the Directive.
The former is defined as *\"the permanent or temporary transfer of all
or a substantial part of the contents of a database to another medium by
any means or in any form,\"* while the latter is *\"any form of making
available to the public all or a substantial part of the contents of a
database by the distribution of copies, by renting, or by other forms of
transmission, including on-line.\"* This rule grants protection to the
producer of a database, irrespective of the database's eligibility for
copyright or other protections. However, actions concerning the
non-substantial part of a database are non-infringing, and the
sui-generis right is limited by first-sale exhaustion. Public lending is
expressly excluded from the scope of protection. The national law of
application determines additional exceptions.

The protection accorded through the sui-generis right is granted for
fifteen years, starting from the completion of the database. It is
possible to renew the term of protection for another fifteen years if
the database has been subjected to a substantial change that required a
significant new investment. However, this creates issues concerning the
incentive provided to database producers, since renewal creates an
incentive to update the database even when there is no real need with
the objective of extending protection [@koboldt1996eu]. Moreover, in the
final draft of the Directive, the compulsory licensing for sole source
databases originally proposed by the European Commission was deleted.
Such a license would have made it possible in those instances where the
stored information could not at all or not without great practical or
financial difficulties be created or gathered independently
[@grosheide2002database]. From a purely economic perspective, however,
the absence of a compulsory licensing scheme equals to granting an
indefinitely long monopoly. Data can be kept reserved but used within
the firm, providing a comparative advantage. Databases are essential for
Artificial Intelligence systems, since machine learning, the
game-changer in the field of AI, needs organized and ready-to-use
data-sets are to build effective predictive models. As a consequence,
inefficiencies in economic welfare are created, increasing the
deadweight loss caused by IPRs in the data economy.

AI and Intellectual Property Rights {#ai_ip}
-----------------------------------

### Limits of IPRs legislation

Unfortunately, the review of the main economic arguments on the best
structure for IP systems remains on a theoretical basis. Since its first
developments in the XIV century, the legal framework that surrounds
patents, and, in general, IPRs, has demonstrated a lack of flexibility
that is in striking contrast with what it aims to protect, that is,
technological innovation and creation. While economists such as
@nordhaus1969economic call for an increase in differentiation in the
nature and degree of IP protection, based on industry and market needs,
the fundamental economics of existing laws remain fixed on old
assumptions and paradigms. This is because legal institutions evolve
incrementally and are focused on preserving the integrity and
consistency of rules, even when there is a dire need of radical
transformations to remain faithful to the rationale and motivations that
gave them birth in the first place [@david1993intellectual]. When
patents first appeared in the XIV century, they were designed to attract
foreign inventions to boost development. They incentivized innovation in
the sense that they promoted the dissemination of precious information
in a national economy, encouraging its growth in the long run, but they
were conceived as a preindustrial system of protection that served
preindustrial or industrial needs. The development of a knowledge-based
economy sharpened the possibility of information to act both as a
capital and a consumer good, and has made evident that the patent system
needs a revision, since the incentives to innovate have changed (as the
success of models such as patentleft and copyleft demonstrated).

The fixed character of IP law has increased the level of uncertainty
regarding the adaptation of IP law to new technologies
[@david1993intellectual]. While patents were designed to promote
innovation, new technologies and economic structures have changed their
role in the economy. Invention is often a cumulative process and the
enforcement of patent rights can interfere with further discovery.
Patent races and inventing-around strategies may deflect resources and
incentivize rent-seeking behavior, while at the same time discouraging
complementary inventions because previous patentees may be able to
extract revenues in downstream innovation [@david1993intellectual]. The
current legal framework is far from being efficient and, in the
meantime, new technologies keep on posing new challenges and requiring
emergency adjustments to the new circumstances. In particular, AI
technologies are posing critical challenges to the IP legal framework,
while at the same time IPRs influence the structure and rate of
innovation, introducing distortions in the market through the
introduction of incentives or disincentives to innovators.

Recently legal scholars have started a lively debate on how to face the
challenges presented by AI to the current legal system. However, as it
was previously mentioned, the legal perspective is intrinsically
limited. Recalling the utilitarian justification, IPRs should be
introduced only when they contribute to the promotion of innovation.
Thus, I argue that the introduction or modification of IPRs regimes
needs to prioritize the economic effects of introducing new norms rather
than continuity with previous legislation. As mentioned in section
[1.1.1.3](#utilitarian){reference-type="ref" reference="utilitarian"},
policymakers should maximize the net social welfare when shaping the
rule of property rights. This requires to strike a balance between
incentives that stimulate innovation and the tendency of IPRs to create
monopoly rights and dysfunctional effects.

In particular, the general statements concerning utilitarian perspective
on IPRs need to be reassessed with the concrete case examined, in our
case the AI market. Unfortunately, since creative and innovation markets
related to AI function under unequal conditions, this is not an easy
task, and, even if IPRs are required to stimulate investments in R&D,
current regimes need to be re-calibrated to take into account both
market and non-market considerations, favoring an increase in the
differentiation of the scope and length of IPRs. For example, a key
factor is the elasticity of product demand, as it was suggested in
section [1.2.1.2.2](#duration){reference-type="ref"
reference="duration"} in relation to optimal patent design
[@nordhaus1969economic]. IPRs are not justified a priori: if in the
market there are already sufficient incentives to promote R&D efforts,
the introduction of monopolies on technology would only reduce society's
welfare, either through monopolies or by adding the administrative costs
of the IP system. @Hilty2020IntellectualPJ explored various economic
paradigms to justify the application of new IPRs to AI technologies: the
general incentive theory, the investment protection theory, and the
prospect theory.

### General incentive theory

General incentive theory is the original argument of IPRs, that we
examined in section [1.1.3](#general_incentive){reference-type="ref"
reference="general_incentive"}. It suggests intellectual outputs would
not be produced without the incentive provided by property rights.
However, it would be short-sighted to affirm that economic rewards are
exclusively tied to mechanisms of appropriation such as IPRs. In
particular, as it was mentioned in section
[1.1.4](#oligopolistic){reference-type="ref" reference="oligopolistic"},
maintaining a stable market position and/or accessing successful market
opportunities may be determinant for a firm to invest in R&D. When we
apply this theory to the AI market, there is no evidence of lack of
motivation to invest in innovation, rather the opposite: AI-related
innovation is thriving. While an under-provision in innovation in the AI
field is still theoretically possible, this may likely be caused by
other bottlenecks in the system, such as the scarcity of AI experts
[@McGowan2019CollidingWA] and data fragmentation [@Martens2018TheIO],
issues that cannot be solved by using IPRs.

When we transpose this approach to the by-products of AI, legal scholars
often claim that without gaining rights to the outputs of AI, developers
have no sufficient incentives to create such AI systems in the first
place [@abbott2017patenting]. However, this does not take into account
that there are different ways through which developers may limit the use
of these systems, such as product-as-a-service (PaaS), in which the use
of the AI system residing in cloud platforms can be controlled by
limiting the number of API calls, the duration of the task and the
amount of the processing power used. Another commonly used business
model is typical of the platform economy, where developers may provide
the opportunity to access to higher-quality, personalized AI systems in
exchange for a periodic fee[^8]. AI system developers can potentially
never fully disclose the AI model to the end-user, thus making their
work profitable without the need to claim ownership on AI by-products.

We can also observe that the AI market has also adopted a
self-regulation model, where actors voluntary share their intangible
assets [@Gonzalez2020TheSO] under various kind of licenses. This
approach is typical of software industry, where many important demanders
actively contributed and distributed open source projects as a source of
complementary innovation [@Wang2020OpenTY], while individual programmers
often collaborated for prestige or good-will, leading to a process where
innovation *feeds* itself. To a lesser extent, we are assisting to a
similar process in the context of the data market, with pleas of the
liberation of data gathered by public administrations in standard,
freely accessible formats (under the open data paradigm) that may lead
to increases in innovation rate and economic competitiveness for private
companies [@Alderete2020TowardsMT].

### Investment protection theory

Investment protection theory focuses on the need to protect the
investments made by the innovators by minimizing free-rider behavior
[@Hilty2020IntellectualPJ]. It was modeled by @nordhaus1969invention,
who applied this framework to technologies whose innovation processes
are long and require high investments in markets with slow innovation
cycles and high probability of imitation and misappropriation. This
paradigm is extremely targeted to market scenarios where incentives to
innovate are low, suggesting the introduction of IPRs as a way to
increase them.

Although AI technologies require a certain degree of investments (such
as high-quality data and computing power), it varies greatly depending
on the specific application sector and scale of the industry. However,
in most cases, AI innovation works through incremental progress which
generally does not require high investment [@Hilty2020IntellectualPJ].
Even if imitation is possible, other systems of protection may already
be in place, such as the database directive. Moreover,
@teece1986profiting affirmed that, in certain cases, investments may
already be protected even when IPRs are not granted at all.
Specifically, he suggested that, in some cases, such as when new
products are difficult to copy, there is no need for state-provisioned
protection. He made the case of cospecialized assets, whose value is
tied by a bilateral relation between two goods: possessing one without
the other is of no use. He affirmed that in the context of innovations
whose value depend on cospecialized assets that can easily be kept
secret, IPRs are of no use, since a mechanism of appropriability is
already in place, thus making the introduction of IPRs detrimental to
economic welfare. A typical example of cospecialized assets in AI
technologies is characterized by algorithms and weights. While
algorithms are often published in scientific papers, weights[^9] are
generally kept secret [@Hilty2020IntellectualPJ]. An AI system without
correlating weights would be valueless for potential free riders.
Moreover, imitation through reverse engineering is possible only to a
certain extent because of the black box effect of ML and, even when it
is possible, it is often more costly than building an original AI
system. This further reduces the incentive for imitation in favor of
autonomous creation. As a consequence, it seems that the investments
undertaken for developing AI systems are already sufficiently protected
and that the introduction of IPRs on the basis of investment protection
theory is not motivated by any economic justification.

Someone may suggest that this is only applicable to AI systems and not
to the by-products of AI. However, the extent to which it may be
reasonable to introduce additional IPRs to AI-aided products largely
depends on the rate of innovation of the specific industry, which
determines the rate of substitution of new products. The utility of AI
outputs is strictly correlated to the time it takes for them to become
obsolete. In other words, when AI-based innovation and creation surpass
a certain threshold, the utility of each AI output reduces, as effect of
incremental innovation, a situation where investment could not be
recouped even with the introduction of IPRs[^10]. A higher rate of
innovation reduces the temporal difference between dynamic efficiency
and static efficiency, making IPRs detrimental to economic welfare. The
rate of innovation depends on the specific economic sector of the AI
output, that cannot be determined before and can only be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis [@Hilty2020IntellectualPJ]. So, while IP protection
for AI outputs may potentially be justified under the investment
protection theory, affirming that a completely new IP regime is needed
for AI by-products is merely speculative and it may be
counterproductive, since it would increase the legal costs associated
with innovation. Considering that current legislation already provides
the possibility to protect AI-aided outputs by mentioning a human as
inventor or author[^11], there is no need to create new IPRs.

### Prospect Theory

In section [1.2.1.2.1](#breadth){reference-type="ref"
reference="breadth"}, I already presented the basis of prospect theory
when referring to @kitch1977nature's proposition for determining optimal
patent breath [@kitch1977nature]. He suggested granting to the inventor
short and broad patents to improve R&D coordination and reduce
over-investment in innovation. In the context of AI technologies,
over-investment may seem relevant, but it would also interfere with the
ability of other innovation to conduct parallel R&D efforts, thus
unnecessarily blocking the way of other innovators. This may
subsequently lead to *\"races to create or invent, which may lead to
wasteful duplication of research effort. Furthermore, instead of
enabling the original inventor to coordinate efficiently the
exploitation of the technology, a quasi-monopoly may lead to satisfying
behaviour and thus to an inefficiently narrow focus on improvements
related to the primary AI creator's or inventor's principal line of
business\"* [@Hilty2020IntellectualPJ]. The introduction of IPRs may
reduce the incentive to proceed with cumulative innovations and favor
rent-seeking behavior. As we will see in chapter
three, this is particularly relevant, since AI
technologies are a General Purpose Technology, and enhancing the scope
of protection on the basis of @kitch1977nature's prospect theory is very
likely to slow down or exacerbate virtuous cycle of complementary
innovation, reducing economic welfare.

Conclusions
-----------

This chapter presented Intellectual Property Rights, a legal institution
that has the declared goal to incentivize innovative behavior. First,
the philosophical foundations for the creation of property rights on
intellectual creations were presented, distinguishing between the
natural rights arguments, the desert argument, and the utilitarian
argument, and accepting the latter as the most reasonable one, since it
is agnostic to the introduction of IPRs. The utilitarian argument
accepts IPRs only to the extent to which they present benefit to society
and it is based on economic analysis. Second, I analyzed three IPRs
strictly involved with AI technologies: patents, copyright and database
sui-generis right. The section was mainly focused on the economics of
patents, the first IPR introduced in the economy, on which other IPRs,
such as copyright, were modeled. Third, I applied the economic analysis
of IPRs to AI technologies. In contrast to the legal literature on the
relations between IPRs and AI, I observed that new IPRs would only be
detrimental to economic welfare and innovation. I determined that the
dynamic character of the AI market and the presence of alternative
systems of appropriation already provide sufficient incentives to embark
in innovative behavior. The introduction of additional IPRs specific of
AI technologies would only represent a burden to the innovative process,
potentially hindering innovation.

[^2]: Imagine a method for anticipating the behavior of financial
    markets

[^3]: the monopoly profit after the invention minus the monopoly profit
    before it

[^4]: In the United States it is generally referred to as
    non-obviousness

[^5]: In jurisprudence, there are two mainstream approaches: the
    doctrine of equivalents and the doctrine of literal interpretation.
    The doctrine of equivalents, extends protection to any product which
    *\"does the same work in substantially the same way to accomplish
    substantially the same result\"* [@Wawrzyniak1990ProvingPI], while
    the doctrine of literal interpretation restricts the protection only
    to what is explicitly claimed in the patent document
    [@meurer2004invention; @lee2010patent]. Both these approaches might
    be problematic, especially in rapidly emerging fields of technology,
    where in addition to real findings, the inventor may have intuitions
    regarding further applications of his invention.

[^6]: Such as innovations that improve the quality of a preexisting
    product or process or the discovery of new applications of an
    already existing technology

[^7]: They are considered mathematical processes and fall in the public
    domain

[^8]: Through the use of a technique called transfer learning

[^9]: Trainable parameters that are optimized during the learning
    process.

[^10]: Which would only increase the deadweight loss and reduce economic
    welfare.

[^11]: Here it is important to underline that AI-produced inventions do
    not exist, as it will be discussed in chapter
